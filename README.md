# C Data Structures Library

This project is used to create some of the main simple data structures in C, using both header files and C source code.
This will primarily be used as a learning experience for me to understand how libraries work in C and also the basic functions of git and github.
Furthermore this project will be used to create reusable pieces of code for the following data structures:
    Queue
    Circular Queue
    Stack   
    Linked List
    Doubly linked list
    Circular Linked List
    Binary Search Tree
